	\block{Introduction and Background}{
	\textbf{OBJECTIVE:} Our research objective for this project was to calculate the symmetry groups for the Reduced Gibbons-Tsarev equation and the Born-Infeld equation, and then determine if they were the same as the symmetry groups for their linearizations.
	\\\\ \textbf{THE EQUATIONS:} Both the Born-Infeld and Reduced Gibbons-Tsarev equations are nonlinear, second-order partial differential equations in two independent variables. The Born-Infeld equation originally popped up in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics and is still found today in string theory in the description of the action of open strings. The Reduced-Gibbons Tsarev equation arose in the context of parametrizations of the Benney moment equations with finitely many (two) dependent variables. It finds use in the study of dispersionless systems.
